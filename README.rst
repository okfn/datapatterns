Contributing
------------

We have several ways you can help. The project is split into a few 
roles. Our **authors** write content, **editors** merge those 
submissions into the handbook, **designers** help beautify it and 
**translators** bring the handbook to all countries of the world.

If you are interested in contributing please either `open an issue`_ or get in
contact on the `mailing list`_.

About our tools
---------------

The handbook is written the `ReStructured Text`_ format. `ReStructured Text`_
allows us to write files in plain text files, which can be nicely rendered 
as a website or a PDF using `Sphinx`_.

Project Layout
--------------

Outline::

  datawrangling/
    text/
    examples
    bin/
    build/

Details:

| ``datawrangling`` is the base directory.
|
|    ``text`` is where we keep the plain text source files.
|
|    ``examples`` is where we put example code and utilities
|
|    ``build`` is where rendered, or "built", HTML files live.  


Rendering the handbook
--------------------

1. Move into the base directory of the project::

    cd datawrangling

2. Install `Sphinx`_, with a minimum version of 1.0. Instructions for 
   Debian and Ubuntu::

    apt-get install python-sphinx

3. Make sure you have installed the theme by initializing the git submodules
   for this repo::

    git submodule init
    git submodule update

4. Render the HTML, using ``make``::

    make html


Deploying the Handbook
----------------------

We use ReadTheDocs to host the handbook. ReadTheDocs will automatically rebuild
the site each time you push a change to the master branch.
