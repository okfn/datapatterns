We are a community of civic hackers, data wranglers and ordinary citizens intrigued and excited by the possibilities of combining technology and information for good – making government more accountable, culture more accessible and science more efficient.

We focus on making things - whether that’s apps, insights or tools. We have a strong preference for [open data](http://opendefinition.org/) and [free/open source software](https://opensource.org/).

We are part of [Open Knwoledge International](https://okfn.org/) and operate as a collaborative community which anyone can join. Labs is organized through a public [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/okfn/okfn.github.com).

## Types of Activities

### Data Wrangling

#### What do we do

#### Skills required

This site is for anyone interested in working with data. It assumes you have a basic working knowledge of UNIX shell commands, the Python programming language, networking, SQL and common file formats like HTML, CSV or XML. If you are not familiar with these technologies, start by working through a tutorial on Python, such as Zed Shaw's Learn Python the Hard Way and then pick up the others as you need them.

### Coding
