Edited directories
------------------

One of the `largest directories of open data repositories`_ is provided 
by the `Open Access Directory`_. Its collection is mostly focused on 
scientific or research data and is curated by topic area. Topics covered
in the directory include archaeology, astronomy, biology, chemistry, 
computer science, energy, environmental sciences, earth sciences,
linguistics, marine sciences, medicine, physics and social sciences.

`CKAN`_ is a directory that largely works through wiki-like edits. Some 
of the benefits of CKAN are that it has well developed client libraries 
that enable you to programmatically access information about each of the 
datasets within its directory. For example, it is easy to ask it to 
tell you which datasets have been released into the public domain.

`Quora`_ has actually become a great source of information about where 
to find data on specific topic areas. It has several questions related 
to this topic which are being continually updated. Some examples include:

* `What are some free, public data sets?`_ 
*  `Where can I get large datasets open to the public?`_
