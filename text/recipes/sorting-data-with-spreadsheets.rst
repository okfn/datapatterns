Sorting Data with Spreadsheets
==============================

**This tutorial uses Google spreadsheets to sort data. Other spreadsheet programs work in a similar way - play around and see how they differ.**

There is sample data for this tutorial `here`_.

#. Select the column you want to sort by in the dropdown menu
#. Try to sort by GDP – Which country has the lowest?
#. Try again with different values, can you sort ascending and descending?

**Tip:** Be careful! A common mistake is to forget to select *all* the data. If you sort without selecting all the data, the rows will no longer match up.
