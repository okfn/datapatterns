Data Quality
************
(included from `data quality outline`_)

The quality of data, as with all information, can be difficult to judge. A
few things to consider when you’re choosing what data to use for a project:

Provenance
==========
Where does the data come from? Who is in charge of it? What is the original
data source, and how far away from that source is the data you’ve found?
Are you able to trace the data back to the source at all?
        
Collection Methodology
======================
How was the data collected? How easy is it to find details about how the data was collected?

Age
===
How old is the data? Does that matter for your purposes?

Purpose
=======
How will you use the data? Are you making a visualization that will influence public policy, or making a silly graph for your blog?

Trust
=====

Fundamentally, using data requires trust. It’s also good to remember that the people you’re communicating your findings to will probably trust you. See Data Citizenship.
