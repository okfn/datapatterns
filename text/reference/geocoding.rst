Geocoding / Georeferencing Data
===============================

Geocoding is the conversion of a human-readable location name into a numeric (or other machine-processable) location such as a longitude and latitude. For example::

  London
  
  [geocoding] =>

  {
    lat: -0.81,
    lon: 51.745
  }

There are a variety of Geo-coding services. We recommend using one based on **open data** such as the Mapquest Nominatim service which uses the Open Street Map Nominatim database:
