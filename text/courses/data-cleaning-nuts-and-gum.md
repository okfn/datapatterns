Section 1: Nuts and chewing gum
===============================

Introduction
------------

Some things just don't go together. These things include a stuffed toy puppy and an electric light, or nuts and chewing gum:

In spreadsheets, formatting and data don't go together. Behold the consequences of spreadsheet formatting:

You’ve probably received something as aesthetically abhorrent as the above. Creators of spreadsheets spend a lot of time formatting data in ways that they find useful to them. They change the text size, colour in the cells, introduce borders and lines to give emphasis to the things they are interested in. However, these may not be useful to you as a receiver of that data, and may get in the way of your ability to use the data.

By the end of this section, you’ll have gained the following:

-   practical knowledge of common formatting and layout features of spreadsheets.
-   the skills to transform data other people give from a stuffed toy puppy lamp to something less distracting.
-   some ideas about how to present your raw data to others so they will love you!

Some work
---------

To do both the quick and longer tasks below you’ll need:

-   a spreadsheet tool, such as Excel or Libre Office.
-   a copy of the course dataset, which is GRAIN’s data on “land grabbing” (available [here](http://datahub.io/dataset/grain-landgrab-data/resource/af57b7b2-f4e7-4942-88d3-83912865d116)).

### A quick task (15-30 minutes)

Ready to make a mess? Let’s try and get into the minds of people who make spreadsheets as ugly as a stuffed toy puppy lamp.

In his excellent essay “The Art of Spreadsheets” John Raffensperger lists [37 ways that you can hide data in a spreadsheet](http://john.raffensperger.org/ArtOfTheSpreadsheet/Chapter09_ShowAllTheInformation.html).
Here are 10 of them:

-   Do not share the file. This is the most common way of hiding information, and the most effective.
-   Hide the sheet. You need at least two sheets first, then: `Format`, `Sheet`, `Hide`.
-   Hide the row: `Format`, `Row`, `Hide`.
-   Hide the column: `Format`, `Column`, `Hide`.
-   Hide the cell and protect the sheet: Format, Cells, Protection, Hidden, then Tools, Protection. This shows a display, but hides the `formula: =if(1, “Peace!”, “Attack at dawn.”)`.
-   Make the column too narrow: `Format`, `Column`, `Width`, `0`.
-   For formulas that are likely to be zero, use `Tools`, `Options`, `View`, and clear the `Zero` values box. For example: `=IF(1, 0, “Attack at dawn.”)`.
-   Use a formula that returns a blank: `=IF(1, “ ”, “Attack at dawn.”)`.
-   Create a complicated formula that displays the information, but format it as text (with `Format`, `Cells`, `Number`, `Text`, or just start the cell with a single quotation mark), so the formula is displayed rather than the output.
-   Format the font with Wingdings: `Format`, `Cells`, `Font`, `Wingdings`. This displays unintelligible characters.

Using John Raffensperger's list as inspiration, your task is to mess up the GRAIN data as much as possible. Marks will be awarded for:

-   making the presentation just bad enough that someone using the data might be tempted to think they can still use it!
-   the use of colour and font effects in ways that really offend the eye
-   ingenuity in hiding bits of data in plain sight.

When you’re finished making a mess, consider how you would undo it and persuade others not to treat their data in this way.

### A longer task (30-60 minutes)

-   From the Data Wrangling Handbook Recipe on Data Cleaning, run through Problem 1: [Showing the data plainly using the GRAIN data](http://schoolofdata.org/handbook/recipes/cleaning-data-with-spreadsheets/#problem-1-showing-the-data-plainly).
This shows you how to remove formatting quickly. It is the first part of a longer ‘recipe’ on data cleaning.

Rest and reflect
----------------

Well, you must now be exhausted, so let’s pause a little and consider what we’ve been doing. Here are a few questions to get you started:

1.  Are there times when formatting is useful?
2.  What are the downsides of removing formatting from a spreadsheet?
3.  How should we visually display data in the tools that we work with every day?

Talk about it in the comments threads if you like.
