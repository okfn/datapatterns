*Data wrangling for fun and profit*

This handbook is not a finished document but a collection of opinions and evolving best practices. The purpose is not to present all available options and technologies but to pick one and follow it through.

The Handbook is also a collaborative effort: if you have a recipe, a tool or a howto and would like to share them, please contribute a patch or make a suggestion.

The Handbook consists of two main parts:

* Guides and Tutorials: Guides and tutorials that walks you the main aspects of data wrangling
* [Patterns](patterns/): A set of "patterns" or recipes for doing specific tasks from scraping an HTML table to geocoding in a spreadsheet

##Â Guides and Tutorials

* [Introduction CSV - the Lingua Franca of Data](csv/)
* [Glossary of Terms](glossary/)
