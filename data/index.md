title: Welcome to the Labs Handbook!
---

The Labs Handbook is a companion text to the [`School of Data`](http://schoolofdata.org/). Its function is something like a 
traditional textbook - it will provide the detail and background theory to support the School of Data courses and challenges.

The Labs Handbook is currently in an early stage of development. Over the coming months we intend to write more chapters and 
flesh out this skeleton with content and detail. We also hope to expand and improve upon this basic outline, so if there's a 
section that you currently feel is missing, please do [let us know!](https://discuss.okfn.org/c/open-knowledge-labs)

The Labs Handbook is a collaborative endeavour, and we welcome all feedback and contributions. To contribute to the Labs 
Handbook you can:

* Edit directly on the [`Handbook Github Repository`](https://github.com/okfn/handbook)

* Submit an issue to our [`issue tracker`](https://github.com/okfn/handbook/issue)

* Write a new contribution - you can do this in the format and editor of your choice (Google Docs, Open Office, Word, Latex ...) and then email it to `schoolofdata [@] okfn.org`

* Email us ideas and suggestions at `schoolofdata [@] okfn.org`

* Send tweets to [`@SchoolOfData`](http://twitter.com/SchoolOfData)

The Labs Handbook should be accessible to all learners. If you stumble across an unexplained term or a concept that requires more explanation, please do get in touch.
