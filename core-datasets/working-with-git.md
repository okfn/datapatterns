title: Working with Git
---

GitHub is a "free" hosting service based on Git, assuming the role of a control version system. In simple terms, this allows the collaboration of multiple users without having issues with versions. 

Even though GitHub is easier working with the terminal, it also has graphical solutions. However, if you want to increase your productivity with GitHub, the rest of this guide will help you perform the basic commands of Git to create, publish online.

In any case, GitHub has a really comprehensive documentation which can help you resolve any issues not covered here.

The following guide is for Ubuntu users. We try to cover Windows commands as much as possible, even though Windows has a neat graphical interface that can surely help you get your things were you wanted.
